# Blog

My name is Harrison Kiang and this is my blog.
I work with Kubernetes and Machine Learning.

I have been meaning to make a blog for awhile now.
I finally found a way to do it without it being too much of a drag.
This was built with [Hugo Learn Theme](https://github.com/matcornic/hugo-theme-learn).
It looks nice and allows me to just focus on content creation and automates away a lot of the overhead.
I can write in Markdown, create [Mermaid](https://learn.netlify.app/en/shortcodes/mermaid/) diagrams, etc.
