This looks much better in mobile vs desktop.

### Chapter 1

# Philosophy

A few things I believe are true

1. If you automate common tasks you perform, you become your own force multiplier (see [Eliminating Toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/) in the [Google SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html)).


2. A feature doesn't exist unless there's a test for it, because manually testing over and over again is just not worth it

3. Tests should only be written against well-known standards, e.g., REST APIs, and avoid being tightly bound to implementation if possible

4. As long as your code has a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited time budget).

5. Even if your code doesn't have a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited incentive).

6. Companies will never over-provision human resources, just like they will never over-provision cloud resources (or at least shouldn't).

7. "Agile" means something different to everyone, so the term itself doesn't really mean anything. Everyone has an opinion, especially [Deloitte](https://twitter.com/djryan/status/1315063072852242434?s=20).

8. Working near a waterfall is peaceful, but you'll surely get wet while working under one.

9. If you can pass *\<insert regulation\>* audits and still get your job done, you're winning, especially if you can also squeeze in ad-hoc work items during your sprint in a *\<insert regulation\>* compliant fashion.


10. "Plans are useless, but planning is everything" - an [anonymous soldier](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/18/planning/). A great converstion on this topic is available at [Episode 336: Roadmap roadkill and returning to office - Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio/2022/12/26/episode-336-roadmap-roadkill-and-returning-to-office/)

11. Decision makers rightfully deserves accurate and timely information, and you should do everything resonably able to provide them with said information. It makes everyone's lives easier.

12. Clearly communicating is imperitive. Pause and ask what the most valuable information is in a given context.

13. A "Best Practice" often refers to the best way the team lead knows how to do something at that point in time. "Best Practices" should change when the team is aware of a demonstrated better way of doing something.

14. "Best Practices" should then be documented for posterity.

15. Always be learning

16. Posture! Your lower back should be flush with your chair.
