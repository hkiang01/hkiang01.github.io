This looks much better in mobile vs desktop.

### Chapter 1

# Philosophy

A few things I believe are true

1. Clearly communicating is imperitive. Pause and ask what the most valuable information is in a given context.

2. People rightfully deserves accurate and timely information, and you should do everything resonably able to provide them with said information. It makes everyone's lives easier.

3. "Plans are useless, but planning is everything" - an [anonymous soldier](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/18/planning/). A great converstion on this topic is available at [Episode 336: Roadmap roadkill and returning to office - Soft Skills Engineering](https://softskills.audio/2022/12/26/episode-336-roadmap-roadkill-and-returning-to-office/)

4. "Agile" in [this context](https://twitter.com/djryan/status/1315063072852242434?s=20) will ultimately fail to achieve all of its promises. The dirty truth is that planning and communicating over a large mass of people is hard. We're all just trying our best and having some process makes us feel better and we'd feel better if we are at least all on the same page of at least how we communicate and how we plan. Relationships are key.

5. A feature doesn't exist unless there's a test for it, because manually testing over and over again is just not worth it.

6. As long as your code has a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited time budget).

7. Even if your code doesn't have a deadline, it will never be "perfect" (limited incentive).

8. Companies will never over-provision human resources, just like they will never over-provision cloud resources (or at least shouldn't).

9. A "Best Practice" often refers to the best way the team lead knows how to do something at that point in time. "Best Practices" should change when the team is aware of a demonstrated better way of doing something.

10. "Best Practices" should then be documented for posterity.

11. If you automate common tasks you perform, you become your own force multiplier (see [Eliminating Toil](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/eliminating-toil/) in the [Google SRE book](https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/toc/index.html)).

12.  If you can pass *\<insert regulation\>* audits and still get your job done, you're winning, especially if you can also squeeze in ad-hoc work items during your sprint in a *\<insert regulation\>* compliant fashion.

13. Always be learning

14. It's easier to correct your posture now vs later.
